Approach taken

I started by drawing out our Wireframes to a diagram and to plan my project.
After that, I made a planning board and wrote user stories.
I created models, views, and controllers for this app. Full CRUD was achieved using RESTful routing.
Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.

Future Implementations

The ability to have a more detailed list of the books.
