Project Requirements

The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

User of MongoDB and Express to create data CRUD
Produce a RESTful API that expresses at least one model
Authenticate users
Restrict access to the Creation, Updating, and Deletion of resources using an authorization middleware function
Be deployed online using Heroku.

Necessary Deliverables

A working app, hosted somewhere on the Internet
A client application that consumes its own API, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to our hosted, working app in the URL section of our Github repo
A Git repository hosted on Github, with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project


MVP
Some of the MVP that was needed to complete the project:

- A working login page by local login options
- A working create account feature that allows users to create a bookWorm account
- The ability for users to create, edit, and delete a profile
- The ability for users to create, edit and delete book logs
- The ability for users to be able to view logs from previously added ones


Technologies/Frameworks used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB.js


User stories
As a user, I want to keep track of all the book I collect.  I need to organize, and have a list of the books I purchase, or I checkout from the library or get as gift. So having a detailed list of my books will help me not to purchase a book that I already have in my library, or will let me know of what books have I checked out from which library before. This list will also allow me to track the books I have been given to friends as gift, or the books that I purchased as a gift to others.

Approach taken

I started by drawing out our Wireframes to a diagram and to plan my project.
After that, I made a planning board and wrote user stories.
I created models, views, and controllers for this app. Full CRUD was needed using RESTful routing but couldn't complete it.
Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.


What I struggled the most in this project:

My main strugglt with project2 was that, the unit 2 was very loaded and very accelrated and fast-paced, and I fell behind in grasping the whole concept of it at the first time.  It took longer than other student to understand the whole concept of it.  The second week of working on my project was a very good opportunity for me to fully understand the whole concept of this important unit, and thankful for that.  I worked so hard and tried my best to get all the MVP done, and I really made a huge progress.  On the first week I only had my Sign Up rout working, but now I have everything working, but my Delete route. I also had the  hardest time having my Update working properly.  I was able to get the first part of the Update working, which takes the user to the editing form, but  I did not succeed to update one single item/book. 

List of the routes that are working and running:

1- I have my full authentication (Sign Up, Sign In, and Log Out) working, so the user can sign up, make an account and view a user page, and can log out at the end of the session successfully.

2- The user can also Add a book to his list of books, and See the book on the list.  

3- The user also has the option of editing and deleting his books. 

List of the routes that are not working properly:

1- Second part of my Update route, and my Delete rout aren't working properly, but I'm very very close to have it working.  I'm sure that it's just a bug or a minor syntax issue, and I will need to keep debugging it.

Thank you all for giving me this extra time to work more on my project, I actually learned a lot this past week while working on this project.
