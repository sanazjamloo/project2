Project Requirements

The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

User of MongoDB and Express to create data CRUD
Produce a RESTful API that expresses at least one model
Authenticate users
Restrict access to the Creation, Updating, and Deletion of resources using an authorization middleware function
Be deployed online using Heroku.

Necessary Deliverables

A working app, hosted somewhere on the Internet
A client application that consumes its own API, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to our hosted, working app in the URL section of our Github repo
A Git repository hosted on Github, with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project


MVP
Some of the MVP that was needed to complete the project:

- A working login page that includes both local login options
- A working create account feature that allows users to create a bookWorm account
- The ability for users to create, edit, and delete a profile
- The ability for users to create, edit and delete book logs
- The ability for users to be able to view logs from previously added ones


Technologies/Frameworks used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB.js


User stories
As a user, I want to keep track of all the book I collect.  I need to organize, and have a list of the books I purchase, or I checkout from the library or get as gift. So having a detailed list of my books will help me not to purchase a book that I already have in my library, or will let me know of what books have I checked out from which library before. This list will also allow me to track the books I have been given to friends as gift, or the books that I purchased as a gift to others.

Approach taken

I started by drawing out our Wireframes to a diagram and to plan my project.
After that, I made a planning board and wrote user stories.
I created models, views, and controllers for this app. Full CRUD was needed using RESTful routing but couldn't complete it.
Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.

Future Implementations

- Need to complete the authorization and authentication as well as the full CRUD routing.
- The ability to have a more detailed list of the books.
